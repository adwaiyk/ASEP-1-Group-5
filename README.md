Project Synopsis
Introduction
Air pollution is a growing environmental challenge affecting millions of lives worldwide. It leads to respiratory illnesses, 
cardiovascular diseases, and premature deaths. The lack of accessible real-time air quality information limits people’s ability 
to make informed decisions to reduce their exposure to pollution. This project aims to develop an Air Quality Monitoring 
WebView App, a mobile-based solution to monitor and report air quality levels. It will provide real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) 
data, actionable health recommendations, and alerts for hazardous conditions. This app aims to empower individuals to 
protect their health and promote environmental awareness.

Objective
The primary goal is to design and develop a WebView application that: 
1. Monitors air pollution levels in real-time. 
2. Provides location-based AQI data and health recommendations. 
3. Alerts users about dangerous pollution levels and helps mitigate exposure. 
4. Provide users with actionable safety measures.
5. Predict air quality trends using machine learning

Scope of the Project
This app is designed to cater to a wide range of users, including individuals, healthcare professionals, and environmental 
organizations. The key features include: 
1. *Real-time AQI Monitoring*: Access to live air quality data using APIs.
2. *Health Alerts and Recommendations*: Notifications to warn users of unhealthy air conditions along with health advice. 
3. *Location-Based Services*: GPS-based AQI tracking for the user’s current location or other areas of interest. 
4. *Data Visualization*: Graphical representation of air quality trends over time.

Implementation
1. *Data Collection*: 
 - Leverage APIs to fetch air quality data from global monitoring networks. 
2. *App Features*: 
 - Display AQI and pollutant concentrations (e.g., PM2.5, CO, NO2) in a visually intuitive way. 
 - Enable notifications for hazardous AQI levels and provide personalized health advice.
 - Air quality prediction using Machine Learning Models.

Outcome
The *Air Quality Monitoring App* will be a reliable and accessible tool for monitoring air quality. It will empower users to make 
informed decisions to protect their health and raise awareness about the impact of air pollution. This project has potential 
applications in healthcare, urban planning, and environmental policy-making, contributing to a healthier and more sustainable 
future.
